# Hi there! üëã I'm Gaurav Agrawal  

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me  
An aspirant Fullstack Developer with over 10 years of expertise in the eCommerce domain. I have worked on and delivered more than 12 Magento projects with various business models and architectures dependent on demand. Headless architecture, Marketplace Model, B2B & B2C model, Platform as a Service model, and Campaign-based Sales are some of the projects I've worked on.

I am always interested in learning new technologies that help my professional development. Along the route, I have worked with and studied a few other technologies such as Apache Kafka, Nodejs, ElasticSearch, Docker, and others.

## üå± Learning Goals  
- Aim to deepen my understanding and expertise in building scalable, decoupled systems using microservices and headless architectures.
- Explore the potential of PWAs to enhance eCommerce user experience with fast, reliable, and engaging web applications.
- Dive into the growing trend of integrating social media with eCommerce to create interactive, community-driven shopping experiences.
- Focus on improving my knowledge of analytics tools and strategies to drive data-driven decisions and optimize eCommerce performance.
